##TNAPS Documentation 

TNAPS is a free cross-platform application server for .NET, Mono, and Java*, with excellent component-driven architecture.

With TNAPS, server application development is easier than ever - you create your own components or get existing ones from TNAPS Marketplace and combine them into a single application. Imagine building your application from fully-documented and 100% compatible blocks - thatâ€™s what building with TNAPS feels like.

You have more time to think about core levels of your application, without worrying about duplicating and implementing existing services like pdf generation, report building, hosting, etc. Just download required components and use them in your App.
